## About

This application was made to show the use of how to use MYSQL in a website to manage self made databases. We use node express to get our backend server running and handlebars in order to send our data to frontend for users.

This application is a Burger Logger that gives the user the option the create their own type of burger. When the user types in the burger they want to order, the user will press submit to send the burger to the ordered section of the application. The user will also be able to add as many burgers as they like to. When the burger is ordered, the user will be able to devour the burger by pressing the devour button in order to send it to the devoured section of the application on the right. When the burger is devoured, the user will be able to delete the burger off the list of devoured burgers.
